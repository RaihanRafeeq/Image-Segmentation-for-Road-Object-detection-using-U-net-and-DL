# Image-Segmentation-for-Road-Object-detection-using-U-net-and-DL
This project leverages the U-Net architecture and advanced deep learning techniques to accurately segment and detect various objects on the road, enhancing the capabilities of autonomous driving systems

# Objective
The objective of our project is to develop an image segmentation model using the U-Net architecture to detect obstacles in road scenes. By accurately classifying pixels in images, the model should be able to identify and segment areas of interest where obstacles like cars, pedestrians, or other objects are present.


# Goals:
Specific goals involve achieving high accuracy in object detection, minimizing false positives, and ensuring the system's reliability in diverse scenarios.

# Challenges:
Challenges include optimizing the model for real-time processing, adapting to changing lighting conditions, and ensuring robust performance in complex urban environments. Addressing these challenges is crucial for the successful deployment of the image segmentation model in a real-world self-driving car system.
